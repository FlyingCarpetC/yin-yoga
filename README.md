In ancient Chinese philosophy, yin and yang describe how seemingly opposite forces are connected and can help bring balance. This belief also applies to the practice of yoga.

•	A different style
Yin and yang yoga styles move energy throughout the body and help improve physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. But yin yoga offers two components that yan yoga la cks: 
1 ) a focus on stillness and an emphasis on longer, deeper stretching of the tissues that surround your body’s moving parts. 
While most yang styles move quickly and focus on muscles tissues, yin yoga moves slowly and stretches more deeply into the body.

•	A deeper stretch
While most forms of yoga focus on building muscle strength and increasing flexibility, yin yoga centers on stretching deeper connective tissues, such as ligaments, tendons, and deep fascia – the tissue that surrounds muscles. 

•	A passive practice
Because you perform yin yoga while siting or lying down in a passive manner, gravity plays a role in developing a deeper stretch while enabling you to hold postures for longer periods of time. In yin yoga, you are encouraged to relsx and surrender to gravity.

The  principles
•	Find your edge
Knowing when to stop a posture – helps create the essential balance between no sensation and too much sensation in the body. You can learn your edge by stopping at appoint during a posture where you feel intense sensations. If you go beyond that point, you risk injury.

•	Be still
Once you find your edge, you remain still. Paying attention to your tendency to fidgetm move or mentally distract yourself is the purpose of being still. By achieving a meditative state, you’re better able to listen to your body and honour your limits. Being still is critical to your yin yoga practice.

•	Hold the posture
You’öl gain the most fron your yin yoga practice by holding a posture. While most practitioners might start with a 1 – 3 minute hold time, more experienced student might hold asanas anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

3)	Imagine your body being surrounded by a warm, radiant white light.
4)	Inhale slow, steady breath through your nose and imagine yourself breathing in the light.
5)	Allow your body and mind to relax as you exhale slowly through your nose. Remain in this position for as long as desired.
